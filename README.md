# BAMthesis

This GitHub repository contains the Python code and data files used for the empirical analysis in my master's thesis:  
**“Predicting Earnings Surprises and Subsequent Returns Using Machine Learning Algorithms”**  
as part of the MSc. Business Analytics & Management at Rotterdam School of Management, part of the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

## Contents
All relevant code and outputs used in the final analysis are included in the `Code` folder.  
The panel data output is not included due to its large size, but it can be fully reconstructed by running the scripts.

Please run the files in **numerical order** to generate the correct outputs.
